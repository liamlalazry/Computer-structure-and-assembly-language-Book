a.
as we saw we need only one 1 to make the result 1 either so in the example but here nu.2 is already turned on so we WOULD NOT CHANGE ANY THING BUT IF IT WAS TURNED OFF IT WOULD TURN IT ON  
1100 0100
0000 0100
---------
1100 0100
will turn on the seond and the fourth without touching the others
1100 0100
0001 0100 
---------
1101 0100

b.so for this question we cant use or cause with or if 1 bit is 1 the result never be 0 so we need the and operator we learned about earlier
1100 0100
1111 1011
