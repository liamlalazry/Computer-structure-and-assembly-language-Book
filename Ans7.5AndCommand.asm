because the way of counting based on 2 and so each digit is a *2 of the first one the way to check if number is divided by 4 would be AND 00000011 AS THE NUMBER WOULD ALWAYS END WITH 00 IF ANY OF THE BITS IS 1THOSE AFTER THE "AND CALC"  THE NUMBER IS CANT BE DIVIDED BY 4
LETS TRY
111100
000011
WILL BE 00 AND THE NUMBER IS 60
LETS TRY 45
101101
000011
WE GOT 01 SO IT NOT DIVIDED BY 4.
